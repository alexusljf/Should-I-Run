# Should I Run?

Welcome to "Should I Run?"! <br>
I made this web app to learn how to use APIs. <br>

## How to Use

* Users can easily input a city's name into the search bar. 
* Weather conditions for that city will be fetched from the API.
* The weather conditions and a running recommendation will be displayed.<br>

## Tools Used

* OpenWeather's Weather API
* React
* CSS
* GitHub Pages
