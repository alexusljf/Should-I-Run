# Should I Run?

Welcome to "Should I Run?"! <br>
I made this web app to learn how to use APIs. <br>

## How to Use

* Users can easily input a city's name into the search bar.
* Alternatively, Users can select the Country and State from the drop-down menus.
* After the Search Button is clicked, Weather conditions for that city will be fetched from the API.
* The weather conditions and a running recommendation will be displayed.<br>

* For shared city names, specify the country code:
    - eg: _"Melbourne, US"_ and _"Melbourne, AU"_

## Tools Used

* OpenWeather's Weather API (https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)
* shivammathur's Geodata API (https://github.com/shivammathur/countrycity/tree/main)
* React
* Sass
* GitHub Pages

## To-Do

- [x] Convert CSS to SCSS
- [x] Add Night Mode
- [x] Add drop-down box of city and country dropdown boxes for input
- [] Continue work on tests
